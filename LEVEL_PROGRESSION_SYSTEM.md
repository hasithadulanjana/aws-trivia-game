## üîß **Technical Implementation**

### **Backend (Python)**

#### **Question Organization**
```python
levels = {
    1: {
        "name": "AWS Fundamentals",
        "description": "Basic AWS services and core concepts",
        "questions": level_1_questions,
        "pass_percentage": 100,
        "unlock_message": "üéâ Perfect score! You've mastered AWS Fundamentals."
    },
    # ... additional levels
}
```

#### **Level Progression Logic**
```python
def _end_game(self):
    # Check for perfect scores
    perfect_score_players = []
    for session_id, player in self.players.items():
        if player['total_correct'] == len(self.game_questions):
            perfect_score_players.append({
                'session_id': session_id,
                'nickname': player['nickname'],
                'can_advance': self.current_level < get_max_level()
            })
            player['level_progress'][self.current_level] = True
```

#### **Socket Event Handlers**
```python
@socketio.on('advance_to_next_level')
def handle_advance_to_next_level():
    # Validate player can advance
    # Start next level
    # Broadcast level advancement
```

    const currentPlayerPerfect = perfectScorePlayers.find(p => p.nickname === this.nickname);
    
    if (currentPlayerPerfect && currentPlayerPerfect.can_advance) {
        // Show level progression UI
        // Add celebration animations
        // Enable advancement button
    }
}
```

#### **Level Selection Modal**
```javascript
displayAvailableLevels(data) {
    data.levels.forEach(level => {
        // Create level cards with status indicators
        // Show locked/unlocked/completed states
        // Enable level selection for unlocked levels
    });
}
```
