# 🔧 Netlify Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## 🚨 **Common Netlify Deployment Issues & Solutions**

### **Issue 1: Python Build Error**
```
Error: python-build: definition not found: python-3.9.18
Failed to install dependencies
```

**❌ Problem**: Netlify is trying to build a Python app instead of serving static files

**✅ Solution**: 
1. Use the `netlify.toml` configuration file (already included)
2. Set base directory to `netlify-static`
3. Leave build command empty

### **Issue 2: 404 Page Not Found**
```
Page not found
Looks like you've followed a broken link
```

**❌ Problem**: Deploying wrong folder or missing files

**✅ Solution**:
1. Deploy only the `netlify-static/` folder contents
2. Ensure `index.html` is in the root of deployed folder
3. Check `_redirects` file is included

### **Issue 3: JavaScript Not Loading**
```
Game doesn't start, blank page, or console errors
```

**❌ Problem**: Missing JavaScript files or incorrect paths

**✅ Solution**:
1. Verify all files are uploaded:
   - `index.html`
   - `game.js`
   - `questions.js`
   - `_redirects`
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Ensure files are in same directory

## 🎯 **Correct Netlify Settings**

### **Build Settings**
- **Base directory**: `netlify-static`

3. **Deploy**:
   - Click "Deploy site"
   - Wait for deployment to complete
   - Visit your live site!

### **Method 2: Manual Upload**

1. **Download Static Files**:

   cd aws-trivia-game
   git checkout netlify-deployment-fix
   
   # Navigate to static folder
   cd netlify-static
   ```

2. **Create Deployment Package**:
   - Zip the contents of `netlify-static/` folder
   - Include: `index.html`, `game.js`, `questions.js`, `_redirects`

3. **Deploy to Netlify**:

   - Site deploys automatically

### **Method 3: Netlify CLI**

```bash

```

## 🔍 **Debugging Steps**

### **1. Check Deployment Logs**
- Go to Netlify dashboard
- Click on your site
- Go to "Deploys" tab
- Click on latest deploy
- Check build logs for errors

### **2. Test Locally**
```bash
# Navigate to static folder
cd netlify-static

# Open in browser (macOS)
open index.html

# Or use Python server
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Visit: http://localhost:8000
```

### **3. Verify File Structure**
Ensure your deployed folder contains:
```
netlify-static/
├── index.html          ✅ Main game page
├── game.js            ✅ Game logic
├── questions.js       ✅ AWS questions
└── _redirects         ✅ Routing rules
```

### **4. Browser Console Check**
